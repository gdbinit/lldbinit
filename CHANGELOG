v3.0 - 20/04/2023
-----------------

* Full arm64 (AArch64) support for most commands and displays.

* Add new `bm` command to break when specific images/modules are loaded. Super useful to break on dynamic libraries for malware analysis and other reversing tasks. This could be done manually with stop on shared library events setting but this command automates and simplifies the process.

* Cleaned up, simplified, improved and updated code.

* Bug fixes.

* Small changes and improvements to UI.

* Dark theme support. Not really a dark theme for now other than fixing basic colors to look ok. Pull requests?
